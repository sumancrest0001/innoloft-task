## Innoloft front end developer task

This is a front end take away task for the front end developer position at Innoloft. The main goal of this project was to create a multi-tabs based form to get user information. Non-functional header, sidebar and footer are also requirements. Please checkout following [link](https://gitlab.com/innoloft/innoloft_frontend_application) for more detailed requirements.

## Tech Used
- React/Redux
- SASS
- React-icons
- Informed for inputs

## Features added
- multi-tab form inputs
- form validation
- fake ajax call
- redux store for all the important info.

## Future improvements
- styling can be improved,
- modal can be added to display messages
- currently, we can not see already added information when we switch between tabs. It can be changed.
- User can cheat without providing inputs for the UserInformation tab and submit the form. This can be prevented.
- Specific validations can be added to inputs of mainInformation tab.
